## Contributing

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome.

### How to make a clean pull request

- Fork the project.

- COPY `base-project` and rename it to `animated-????????????`

- Create a topic branch from `main | master`.

- Make some commits.

- Push this branch to your GitHub project.

- KEEP IT EXTREAMLY SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE

  - Try only with CSS, else you can use JavaScript

- Open a Pull Request on GitHub.

- Discuss, and optionally continue committing.

- The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense.
Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
