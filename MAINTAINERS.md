    [Org."Core maintainers"]

    # The Core maintainers are the ghostbusters of the project: when there's a problem others
    # can't solve, they show up and fix it with bizarre devices and weaponry.
    # They have final say on technical implementation and coding style.
    # They are ultimately responsible for quality in all its forms: usability polish,
    # bugfixes, performance, stability, etc. When ownership  can cleanly be passed to
    # a subsystem, they are responsible for doing so and holding the
    # subsystem maintainers accountable. If ownership is unclear, they are the de facto owners.
